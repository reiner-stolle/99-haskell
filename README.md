# Personal Solutions to the H-99 

Based off https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

- My attempt to solve the notorious H-99 ("Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems")
- Some problems I couldn't solve and are similar to proposed anwsers in the Haskell wiki

## Files explained 

- playground.hs is as the name suggests just random haskell code which I tested around with
- section1.hs (exercise 1-10)         Lists
- section2.hs (exercise 11-20)        Lists, continued
- section3.hs (exercise 21-30)        Lists again
- section4.hs (exercise 31-40)        Arithmetic
- section5.hs (exercise 41-50)        Logic and codes
